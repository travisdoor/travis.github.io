{: style="text-align: justify;"}
A few days ago I decided to migrate whole C side of Biscuit engine to new object oriented concept
which I call Biscuit Object (BObject).

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
In the first iteration I'm going to reimplement data containers with possibility to automatically
destroy stored objects, but storing of the fundamental types must be possible also. Current containers
implementation use destructor function callback set during initialization, this one has been replaced
by object type. When the object stored in container has to be freed 'bo_delete' is called directly from 
the container. 

{: style="text-align: justify;"}
This approach leads to similar problems like with C++ objects (object copying,
destruction and creation on container resize or manipulation with data), but it can be easily handled
by BObject tools.
