I'm C/C++/C# programmer and musician, currently working for [Craneballs](https://www.craneballs.com)
company as C\# developer working on Virtual Forest data visualisation in Unity Engine. 
I'm creator of the Sandy Engine - procedural planet generator written in C++ and used in 
[Planet Nomads](https://www.planet-nomads.com) sandbox game. I'm also interested in game 
engines and lower level modules used for game development. I enjoy programming in general, it's 
my hobby as well music and guitar playing.

I've started with programming (especially game programming) back in 2004. My first projects
were written in Pascal and Basic. First bigger project was game engine for real time strategy games
as part of my bachelor thesis (check it [here](https://youtu.be/JnqfQBYx5SA)), it was written in C++
and final version of this project covers rendering (OpenGL, GLSL), basic scene and resource management, shadow rendering,
water reflections, texturing, user input, etc.

I joined Craneballs team in 2014. I participated in the [Overkill 2](http://www.overkill2.com) development and
Android porting of this game. I improved my programming skills in real solutions and also learned to work
in a team. In 2015 we started to work on Planet Nomads open world sandbox game where we decided
to create procedural alien environment. The Planet Nomads was created in the Unity engine and my work here was to desing
and implement terrain generator which takes world definitions and noise setup created by designer and than
generates large planetary terrain based on this information.

Even though I'm mostly interested in game development, I'm also enjoying programming languages and it's internals, desing and compilers
so I started programming my own compiler in 2018 as a side project. First idea was to create just a simple frontend translating custom
code into C language, but after few years of development I've ended with fully usable programming language called [Biscuit](http://biscuitlang.org)
using LLVM backend. This language is not complete yet and it's still under development.
