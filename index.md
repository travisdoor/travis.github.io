I'm C/C++/C# programmer and musician, currently working for [Craneballs](https://www.craneballs.com)
company as C++ engine programmer and C# tool programmer. I'm creator of the Sandy Engine - procedural planet
generator written in C++ and used in [Planet Nomads](https://www.planet-nomads.com) sandbox game. I'm also
interested in game engines and lower level modules used for game development. I enjoy programming in general,
it's my hobby as well music and guitar playing.

I've started with programming (especially game programming) back in 2004. My first projects
were written in Pascal and Basic. First bigger project was game engine for real time strategy games
as part of my bachelor thesis (check it [here](https://youtu.be/JnqfQBYx5SA)), it was written in C++
and final version of this project covers rendering (OpenGL, GLSL), basic scene and resource management, shadow rendering,
water reflections, texturing, user input, etc.

I joined Craneballs team in 2014. I participated in the [Overkill 2](http://www.overkill2.com) development and
Android porting of this game. I improved my programming skills in real solutions and also learned to work
in a team. In 2015 we started to work on Planet Nomads open world sandbox game where we decided
to create procedural alien environment. The Planet Nomads was created in the Unity engine and my work here was to desing
and implement terrain generator which takes world definitions and noise setup created by designer and than
generates large planetary terrain based on this information.
