I'm C/C++/C# programmer and musician, currently working for [Craneballs](https://www.craneballs.com)
company as C++ engine programmer and C# tool programmer. I'm creator of the Sandy Engine - procedural planet
generator written in C++ and used in [Planet Nomads](https://www.planet-nomads.com) sandbox game.
 
I've started with programming (especially game programming) back in 2004. My first projects
was written in Pascal and Basic. First bigger project was game engine for real time strategy games
as part of my bachelor thesis (check out [here](https://youtu.be/JnqfQBYx5SA)), it was written in C++
and final version of this project covers rendering (OpenGL, GLSL), basic scene and resource management, shadow rendering,
water reflections, texturing, user input, etc.
